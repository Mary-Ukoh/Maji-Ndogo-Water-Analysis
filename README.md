![](intro.jpeg)
Access to clean and safe water is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people worldwide still lack access to this essential resource. In alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) - ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all - the project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of water access in Maji Ndogo. Maji Ndogo, grappling with a water crisis, serves as a focal point for this investigation. The primary objectives of this analysis are to assess the existing water resources, evaluate the accessibility of water services, and provide recommendations to enhance access to basic water services within the community.

In Maji Ndogo, the availability and reliability of water sources directly impact the quality of life and well-being of its residents. Thus, understanding the distribution, reliability, and usability of water sources is crucial. This project seeks to delve into the intricacies of water access by examining the types of water sources utilized by the community, determining the total and average number of users for each source, and exploring the duration individuals typically spend waiting in queues to access water.
